# bottest1234
discord.js bot made by iexist, doesn't have much commands right now. it all started back in 2015 when discord came to life. then somewhere in the timeline discord.js was released. in july 2021 the bottest1234 was coded in some shitty tool to make discord bots and had more commands than now. then in september the bot was shutdown, never to be touched again. until the same idiot who made the bot decided, huh, i should completely reset the code and put it on github! and the same idiot made a fucking math command using eval that could've been used to crash the bot. anyways moderation commands won't come out soon, so it's currently just a chatbot. do c!contact to annoy me but please use it to give ideas and feedback.
